# Yass Reloaded Karaoke Editor
Yass Reloaded is a graphical editor for finetuning Ultrastar karaoke songs. 
You can drag & drop notes, spread syllables, and find errors. Further you can filter your song library, mass-tag or batch-correct them, or search for lyrics.

Yass Reloaded is a fork from Yass 2.4.3 that Saruta has been developing since 2009. Due to time constraints on his behalf and "creative differences" with the other contributors, I decided to go rogue with my fork.

Yass Reloaded has been localized to:
- English
- German
- French
- Spanish
- Polish
- Hungarian

French has just recently been added and been translated by AI. Please let me know, if you find any mistakes or missing translations.
If you want to help me localize Yass Reloaded to your language, please let me know as well.

# Main Differences to the original Yass
- Better support for audio formats. Note, that FFmpeg is now required, so support any audio format that FFmpeg supports, such as AAC, OGG or OPUS
- Improved UX: Coming from someone who has created hundreds of songs, many little tweaks and improvements have gone into Yass Reloaded to make things easier
  - Better copy-pasting
  - BPM, GAP, START, END tags can now directly be edited without having to open additional dialogs
- Faster bugfixing: Many issues, that are still open in the original Yass have already been dealt with in Yass Reloaded. Any new issues that arise will also be reviewed and fixed
- The Ultrastar community has decided to enhance the current Ultrastar format by adding new tags. Theses enhancements are also constantly incorporated into the software.
- Is developed in Java 21 instead of Java 8. Third party libraries will be kept up-to-date

# Downloads
Binaries can be found in the [Release Section](https://github.com/DoubleDee73/Yass/releases)

Min. Requirement is Java 21 (e. g. Open JDK ZuluFX https://www.azul.com/downloads/).
While JavaFX is no longer required, it may be needed in future releases.

Yass Reloaded requires FFmpeg to support a variety of audio formats.

# Troubleshooting
## Yass Reloaded does nothing after showing the splash screen
- Have you checked your Java version? 
  - Open a command line window and type in <code>java -version</code>. 
  - You should have Java 21
- Have you tried opening it as a jar?
  - Download the jar, open a command line window and type in <code>java -jar Yass-Reloaded-2025.9.jar</code>
  - Any error messages are then printed out in the command line window for debugging

## Cannot find FFmpeg?
Yass Reloaded has a built-in auto-detection for FFmpeg. 
It will look in any PATH environment variables and try to find both ffmpeg and ffprobe.  
If you are sure, you have installed ffmpeg, maybe you did not choose to have the PATH variable automatically configured.  
If this is the cae, then it is recommended, that you add the FFmpeg path to your PATH variables

You can also add the path to FFmpeg to the Yass Reloaded configuration file. The user.xml should be in the ~/.yass/ folder

There should be an entry:

<code>&lt;entry key="ffmpegPath">&lt;/entry></code>

If it's not, add it, and put the FFmpeg path before &lt;/entry>, e. g.:

<code>&lt;entry key="ffmpegPath">/usr/bin&lt;/entry></code>

or

<code>&lt;entry key="ffmpegPath">C:\ffmpeg\bin&lt;/entry></code>

depending on your OS.

It is also possible, that when you use Automator on Mac to start Yass Reloaded, 
that due to restrictions to the PATH variables, the auto-detection fails.

In this case, start Yass Reloaded from the console. If FFmpeg is then detected, the path
will be written into the user.xml, and you can use Automator again.
