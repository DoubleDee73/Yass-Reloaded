<h2>Create New Song</h2>

Now specify your MP3 file. Please note that if it was encoded with variable bitrate (VBR), 
older versions of UltraStar might have issues with it. 
If the original source comes from YouTube, it is recommended to choose Opus or Ogg, 
as M4A or MP3 files may have slight delays in the gap due to transcoding.
The file will be copied to the song directory.

Please choose the audio file.
